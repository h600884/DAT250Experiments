## Lab report : DAT250 experiment 7

### JPA PostgreSQL docker image

For the postgres image I used the official postgres docker image. In the documentation it stated I should use port 5432, but I was unable to do that since something that I don't know was using that port.
Because of that I had to use port 5433 to connect to the database.



### My own docker image for the poll application
