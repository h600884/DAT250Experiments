## Lab report: DAT250 Experiment 2

I began working on the lab before the Step-by-Step guide on GitHub was available, so I didn’t initially follow the approach outlined there. The main issue was that my initial implementation didn’t fully align with the requirements of the test we were supposed to run.

When I had done most of the classes I began with some testing using the HTTP client "Bruno". I have also done some JUnit testing with a test class. But due to some problems with my code the test does not pass. Since it has been some time since I have written such tests classes and due to limited time it was difficult getting the test to pass.  

The experiment is not completely finish, I have had some troubles getting the voting mechanism to work. But everything with the user works as expected, and I am able to create, delete and update a poll but not vote on it. Unfortunately I was not able to finish this due to running out of time with the assignment.
